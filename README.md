## Getting started

Smol Events is an event management platform for sending email invitations and collecting RSVPs.
Perfect for your next birthday bash!


## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Smol Events should be ready for others to test, but it hasn't been battle tested, just birthday party tested.

- Configure database settings in `.env`. I've tested it with `mysql` and `sqlite`.
- Install PHP dependencies via `composer install`
- Install Node dependencies via `npm install && npm run build`
- Run migrations via `php artisan migrate`
